The **Employee Management System** is a full-stack application built using **Spring Boot** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **MySQL** as the database, with the entire system fully containerized using **Dockerfile and Docker Compose**. The backend exposes REST APIs and is packaged as a Spring Boot JAR using a Dockerfile, while the database runs in a dedicated MySQL container with data persisted through Docker volumes to ensure no data loss across container restarts. The frontend uses two Dockerfiles: `Dockerfile.dev` for development, which runs the React app and a production `Dockerfile` that uses a multi-stage build to compile the React app and serve it efficiently through Nginx. Docker Compose orchestrates all services, manages inter-service dependencies, and connects the frontend, backend, and database using a custom Docker network created with the **bridge driver**, enabling secure and reliable container-to-container communication.
